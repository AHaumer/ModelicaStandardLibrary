Calculation of the mean convective heat transfer coefficient <b> kc </b> of a helical pipe in a hydrodynamically developed laminar and turbulent flow regime.
</p>
<h4>Functions <b>kc_overall</b> and <b>kc_overall_KC</b></h4>
<p>
There are basically three differences:
<ul>
<li>
The function <b>kc_overall</b> is using <b>kc_overall_KC</b> but offers additional output variables like e.g. Reynolds number or Nusselt number and failure status (an output of <b>1</b> means that the function is not valid for the inputs).</li>
<li>
Generally the  function <b>kc_overall_KC</b> is numerically best used for the calculation of the mean convective heat transfer coefficient <b> kc </b> at known mass flow rate.</li>
<li>
You can perform an inverse calculation from <b>kc_overall_KC</b>, where an unknown mass flow rate is calculated out of a given mean convective heat transfer coefficient <b> kc </b>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>Geometry and Calculation </h4>

<p>This heat transfer function enables a calculation of heat transfer coefficient for laminar and turbulent flow regime. The geometry, constant and fluid parameters of the function are the same as for
<a href="kc_laminar.html#Geometry">kc_laminar</a>  and <a href="kc_turbulent.html#Geometry">kc_turbulent</a>. 

The calculation conditions for laminar and turbulent flow is equal to the calculation in <a href="kc_laminar.html#calculation">kc_laminar</a>  
and <a href="kc_turbulent.html#calculation">kc_turbulent</a>. A smooth transition between both functions is carried out between 2200 &le; Re &le; 30000 (see figure below). </p>

<h4>Verification</h4>
<p>
The mean Nusselt number <b> Nu </b> representing the mean convective heat transfer coefficient <b> kc </b> is shown below for different numbers of turns <b> n_nt </b> at constant total length of the helical pipe.

</p>

<p>
The convective heat transfer of a helical pipe is enhanced compared to a straight pipe due to occurring turbulences resulting out of centrifugal forces. The higher the number of turns, the better is the convective heat transfer for the same length of a pipe.
</p>

<p>
Note that the ratio of hydraulic diameter to total length of helical pipe <b> d_hyd/L </b> has no remarkable influence on the coefficient of heat transfer <b> kc </b>.

Calculation of pressure loss for a valve with different geometries at overall flow regime for incompressible and single-phase fluid flow in dependence of its opening.
</p>

<p>
This function can be used to calculate both the pressure loss at known mass flow rate <b> or </b> mass flow rate at known pressure loss within one function in dependence of the known
variable (dp or m_flow).
</p>

<p>
Generally this function is numerically best used for the <b> incompressible case </b>, where the mass flow rate (m_flow) is known (as state variable) in the used model and the corresponding pressure loss (DP) has to be calculated. On the other hand the function <a href="modelica://Modelica.Fluid.Dissipation.PressureLoss.Valve.dp_severalGeometryOverall_MFLOW">dp_severalGeometryOverall_MFLOW</a> is numerically best used for the <b> compressible case </b> if the pressure loss (dp) is known (out of pressures as state variable) and the mass flow rate (M_FLOW) has to be calculated.

<h4><font color="#EF9B13">Geometry</font></h4>
</p>
Wide variations in valve geometry are possible and a manufacturer will not necessarily maintain geometric similarity between valves of the same type but of different size. Here pressure loss can be estimated for the following types of a valve:
<ul>
 <li>
      <b> ball valve </b>
 </li>
 <li>
      <b> diaphragm valve </b>
 </li>
 <li>
      <b> butterfly valve </b>
 </li>
 <li>
      <b> gate valve </b>
 </li>
 <li>
      <b> sluice valve </b>
 </li>
</ul>

<h4><font color="#EF9B13">Calculation</font></h4>
The pressure loss <b> dp </b> for valves is determined by:
<p>
<pre>
    dp = (zeta_TOT/2) * rho * velocity^2
    dp = 1/(valveCharacteristic^2)* rho * velocity^2
    dp = 1/(valveCharacteristic^2 * Av^2 * rho) *(m_flow)^2
</pre>

<tr><td><b> Av                         </b></td><td> as (metric) flow coefficient (cross sectional area) [m^2],</td></tr>

</p>

<p>
The <b>valveCharacteristic</b> is determined out of a correlation for the pressure loss coefficient (<b>zeta_TOT</b>) in dependence of its opening. The reason for introducing an additional variable
<b>valveCharacteristic</b> is a different definition of the following pressure loss correlations of valves.
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Using coefficient Av with [Av]=m^2 and [V_flow]=m^3/s, [dp]=Pa:
     <br>
     <pre>
      V_flow = Av * (dp/rho)^0.5
     </pre>
  <li> Using coefficient Kv with [Kv]=m^3/(h*bar^0.5) and [V_flow]=m^3/h, [dp]=bar :
     <br>
     <pre>
      V_flow = Kv * [dp/(rho/rho0)]^0.5
     </pre>
  <li> Using coefficient Cv with [Cv]=USG/(min*psi^0.5) and [V_flow]=USG/min, [dp]=psi :
     <br>
     <pre>
      V_flow = Cv * [dp/(rho/rho0)]^0.5
     </pre>
</ul>
The different flow coefficients <b>Kv and Cv</b> are often given in manufacturer data instead of <b>Av</b> to describe pressure loss of valves. Here a geometry of a valve can be chosen and the specific manufacturer data for the flow coefficients can be used. Then values for given <b>Kv and Cv</b> are converted into <b>Av</b> used in pressure loss calculation
(see <a href="modelica://Modelica.Fluid.UsersGuide.ComponentDefinition.ValveCharacteristics">User's Guide</a> for detailed discussion).

The pressure loss coefficient (<b>zeta_TOT</b>) for several geometries of valves is calculated according to <i>[Miller 1978, sec. 14.6, p. 270ff]</i> :
<ul>
  <li> <b>Ball valve</b>:
     <br>
     <pre>
      zeta_TOT = 10^(-3.8397 * opening + 2.9449)
     </pre>
  <li> <b>Diaphragm valve</b>
      <br>
     <pre>
      zeta_TOT = 10^[2.2596*exp(-1.8816 * opening)]
     </pre>
 <li> <b>Butterfly valve</b>
      <br>
     <pre>
     zeta_TOT = 619.81*exp(-7.3211*opening)
     </pre>
 <li> <b>Gate valve</b>
      <br>
     <pre>
     zeta_TOT = 51.45*exp(-6.046*opening)
     </pre>
 <li> <b>Sluice valve</b>
      <br>
     <pre>
     zeta_TOT = 248.89*exp(-7.8265*opening)
     </pre>
</ul>
<p>
with
</p>
<p>
<table>
<tr><td><b> opening       </b></td><td> as amount of opening of a valve from 0% to 100% [-],</td></tr>
<tr><td><b> zeta_TOT      </b></td><td> as pressure loss coefficient [-].</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

Note that the pressure loss coefficients for an overall fluid flow are obtained out of the turbulent regime.

<p>
The pressure loss coefficient (<b>zeta_TOT</b>) of a valve with different geometries are shown in dependence of the <b>opening</b> in the figure below.
<p>
<img src="../../../../../Images/FluidDissipation/pressureLoss/valve/fig_valve_dp_severalGeometryOverall_zetaVsOpening.png">
</p>
<p>
Note that the pressure loss coefficients (<b>zeta_TOT</b>) are numerically optimised for very small openings (opening &le; 5%). At openings smaller than 5% the pressure loss coefficient is smoothly set
to a maximum value (<b>zeta_TOT_max</b>) to be adjusted as parameter. Therefore a very small leakage mass flow rate can be adjusted for a given pressure difference at almost closed valves. A very small
leakage mass flow rate can often be neglected in system simulation with valves, whereas the numerical behaviour of the simulation is improved.
</p>
<p>
The pressure loss of different valves at a constant opening of 50% in dependence of mass flow rate is shown in the figure below.

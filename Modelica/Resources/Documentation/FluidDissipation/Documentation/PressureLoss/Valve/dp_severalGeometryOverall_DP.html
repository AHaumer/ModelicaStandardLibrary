Calculation of pressure loss for a valve with different geometries at overall flow regime for incompressible and single-phase fluid flow in dependence of its opening.
</p>
<h4>Restriction</h4>
<p>
This function shall be used inside of the restricted limits according to the referenced literature.
<ul>
 <li>
      <b> developed fluid flow </b>
 </li>
 <li>
      <b> ball valve </b>
 </li>
 <li>
      <b> diaphragm valve </b>
 </li>
 <li>
      <b> butterfly valve </b>
 </li>
 <li>
      <b> gate valve </b>
 </li>
 <li>
      <b> sluice valve </b>
 </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>Geometry</h4>
<p>
Wide variations in valve geometry are possible and a manufacturer will not necessarily maintain geometric similarity between valves of the same type but of different size. Here pressure loss can be estimated for the following types of a valve:
<ul>
 <li>
      <b> ball valve </b>
 </li>
 <li>
      <b> diaphragm valve </b>
 </li>
 <li>
      <b> butterfly valve </b>
 </li>
 <li>
      <b> gate valve </b>
 </li>
 <li>
      <b> sluice valve </b>
 </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>Calculation</h4>
<p>
The pressure loss <b> dp </b> for valves is determined by:
<pre>
    dp = (zeta_TOT/2) * rho * velocity^2
    dp = 1/(valveCharacteristic^2)* rho * velocity^2
    dp = 1/(valveCharacteristic^2 * Av^2 * rho) *(m_flow)^2
</pre>
</p>

<p>
with
</p>

<p>
<table>
<tr><td><b> rho                        </b></td><td> as density of fluid [kg/m3],</td></tr>
<tr><td><b> Av                         </b></td><td> as (metric) flow coefficient (cross sectional area) [m^2],</td></tr>
<tr><td><b> m_flow                     </b></td><td> as mass flow rate [kg/s],</td></tr>
<tr><td><b> valveCharacteristic        </b></td><td> as coefficient of a valve in dependence of its opening [-],</td></tr>
<tr><td><b> velocity                   </b></td><td> as mean velocity [m/s],</td></tr>
<tr><td><b> zeta_TOT                   </b></td><td> as pressure loss coefficient [-].</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
The <b>valveCharacteristic</b> is determined out of a correlation for the pressure loss coefficient (<b>zeta_TOT</b>) in dependence of its opening. The reason for introducing an additional variable
<b>valveCharacteristic</b> is a different definition of the following pressure loss correlations of valves.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li> Using coefficient Av with [Av]=m^2 and [V_flow]=m^3/s, [dp]=Pa:</li>
     <pre>
      V_flow = Av * (dp/rho)^0.5
     </pre>
  <li> Using coefficient Kv with [Kv]=m^3/(h*bar^0.5) and [V_flow]=m^3/h, [dp]=bar:</li>
     <pre>
      V_flow = Kv * [dp/(rho/rho0)]^0.5
     </pre>
  <li> Using coefficient Cv with [Cv]=USG/(min*psi^0.5) and [V_flow]=USG/min, [dp]=psi:</li>
     <pre>
      V_flow = Cv * [dp/(rho/rho0)]^0.5
     </pre>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The different flow coefficients <b>Kv and Cv</b> are often given in manufacturer data instead of <b>Av</b> to describe pressure loss of valves. Here a geometry of a valve can be chosen and the specific manufacturer data for the flow coefficients can be used. Then values for given <b>Kv and Cv</b> are converted into <b>Av</b> used in pressure loss calculation
(see <b>Modelica.Fluid.UsersGuide.ComponentDefinition.ValveCharacteristicsUser</b> for detailed discussion).
</p>
<p>
The pressure loss coefficient (<b>zeta_TOT</b>) for several geometries of valves is calculated according to <i>[Miller 1978, sec. 14.6, p. 270ff]</i> :
<ul>
  <li> <b>Ball valve</b>:</li>
     <pre>
      zeta_TOT = 10^(-3.8397 * opening + 2.9449)
     </pre>
  <li> <b>Diaphragm valve</b></li>
     <pre>
      zeta_TOT = 10^[2.2596*exp(-1.8816 * opening)]
     </pre>
 <li> <b>Butterfly valve</b></li>
     <pre>
      zeta_TOT = 619.81*exp(-7.3211*opening)
     </pre>
 <li> <b>Gate valve</b></li>
     <pre>
      zeta_TOT = 51.45*exp(-6.046*opening)
     </pre>
 <li> <b>Sluice valve</b></li>
     <pre>
     zeta_TOT = 248.89*exp(-7.8265*opening)
     </pre>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
with
</p>
<p>
<table>
<tr><td><b> opening       </b></td><td> as amount of opening of a valve from 0% to 100% [-],</td></tr>
<tr><td><b> zeta_TOT      </b></td><td> as pressure loss coefficient [-].</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
Note that the pressure loss coefficients for an overall fluid flow are obtained out of the turbulent regime.
</p>

<h4>Verification</h4>
<p>
The pressure loss coefficient (<b>zeta_TOT</b>) of a valve with different geometries are shown in dependence of the <b>opening</b> in the figure below.
</p>
<p>
<img src="../../../../../Images/FluidDissipation/pressureLoss/valve/fig_valve_dp_severalGeometryOverall_zetaVsOpening.png">
</p>
<p>
Note that the pressure loss coefficients (<b>zeta_TOT</b>) are numerically optimised for very small openings (opening &le; 5%). At openings smaller than 5% the pressure loss coefficient is smoothly set
to a maximum value (<b>zeta_TOT_max</b>) to be adjusted as parameter. Therefore a very small leakage mass flow rate can be adjusted for a given pressure difference at almost closed valves. A very small
leakage mass flow rate can often be neglected in system simulation with valves, whereas the numerical behaviour of the simulation is improved.
</p>
<p>
The pressure loss of different valves at a constant opening of 50% in dependence of mass flow rate is shown in the figure below.

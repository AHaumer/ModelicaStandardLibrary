</p>
Wide variations in valve geometry are possible and a manufacturer will not necessarily maintain geometric similarity between valves of the same type but of different size. Here pressure loss can be estimated for the following types of a valve:
<ul>
 <li>
      <b> ball valve </b>
 </li>
 <li>
      <b> diaphragm valve </b>
 </li>
 <li>
      <b> butterfly valve </b>
 </li>
 <li>
      <b> gate valve </b>
 </li>
 <li>
      <b> sluice valve </b>
 </li>
</ul>

<h4><font color="#EF9B13">Calculation</font></h4>
The mass flow rate <b> m_flow </b> for valves out of pressure loss is determined by:
<p>
<pre>
    m_flow = [rho * dp * Av^2 / (zeta_TOT/2]^0.5
    m_flow = (2/zeta_TOT)^0.5 * Av * (rho * dp)^0.5
    m_flow = valveCharacteristic * Av * (rho * dp)^0.5
</pre>

<p>
The <b>valveCharacteristic</b> is determined out of a correlation for the pressure loss coefficient (<b>zeta_TOT</b>) in dependence of its opening. The reason for introducing an additional variable
<b>valveCharacteristic</b> is a different definition of the following pressure loss correlations of valves.

The pressure loss calculation for valves of several geometries is further documented <a href="dp_severalGeometryOverall_DP.html">dp_severalGeometryOverall_DP</a>.

<h4><font color="#EF9B13">Verification</font></h4>
<p>
The pressure loss coefficient (<b>zeta_TOT</b>) of a valve with different geometries are shown in dependence of the <b>opening</b> in the figure below.
<p>

</p>
<p>
Note that the pressure loss coefficients (<b>zeta_TOT</b>) are numerically optimised for very small openings (opening &le; 5%). At openings smaller than 5% the pressure loss coefficient is smoothly set
to a maximum value (<b>zeta_TOT_max</b>) to be adjusted as parameter. Therefore a very small leakage mass flow rate can be adjusted for a given pressure difference at almost closed valves. A very small
leakage mass flow rate can often be neglected in system simulation with valves, whereas the numerical behaviour of the simulation is improved.
</p>
<p>
The mass flow rate of different valves at a constant opening of 50% in dependence of pressure loss is shown in the figure below.

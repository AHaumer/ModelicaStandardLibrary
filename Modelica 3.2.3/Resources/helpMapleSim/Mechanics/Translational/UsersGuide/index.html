<h3>Information</h3>
<p>


<p>
This package contains components to model <strong>1-dimensional translational
mechanical</strong> systems, including different types of masses,
external forces, spring/damper elements,
frictional elements, elastogaps, elements to measure position, velocity,
acceleration and the cut-force of a flange. In sublibrary
<strong>Examples</strong> several examples are present to demonstrate the usage of
the elements. Just open the corresponding example model and simulate
the model according to the provided description.
</p>
<p>
A unique feature of this library is the <strong>component-oriented</strong>
modeling of <strong>Coulomb friction</strong> elements, such as support friction.
Even (dynamically) coupled friction elements can be handled
<strong>without</strong> introducing stiffness which leads to fast simulations.
The underlying theory is new and is based on the solution of mixed
continuous/discrete systems of equations, i.e., equations where the
<strong>unknowns</strong> are of type <strong>Real</strong>, <strong>Integer</strong> or <strong>Boolean</strong>.
Provided appropriate numerical algorithms for the solution of such types of
systems are available in the simulation tool, the simulation of
(dynamically) coupled friction elements of this library is
<strong>efficient</strong> and <strong>reliable</strong>.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../../Images/Mechanics/Translational/drive1.png" alt="drive1">
</p>

<p>
A simple example of the usage of this library is given in the
figure above. This drive consists of a shaft with mass m1=1 which
is connected via a spring to a second shaft with mass m2=5.
The left shaft is driven via an external, sinusoidal force.
The <strong>filled</strong> and <strong>non-filled green squares</strong> at the left and
right side of a component represent <strong>mechanical flanges</strong>.
Drawing a line between such squares means that the corresponding
flanges are <strong>rigidly attached</strong> to each other.
By convention in this library, the connector characterized as a
<strong>filled</strong> green square is called <strong>flange_a</strong> and placed at the
left side of the component in the "design view" and the connector
characterized as a <strong>non-filled</strong> green square is called <strong>flange_b</strong>
and placed at the right side of the component in the "design view".
The two connectors are completely <strong>identical</strong>, with the only
exception that the graphical layout is a little bit different in order
to distinguish them for easier access of the connector variables.
For example, <code>m1.flange_a.f</code> is the cut-force in the connector
<code>flange_a</code> of component <code>m1</code>.
</p>
<p>
The components of this
library can be <strong>connected</strong> together in an <strong>arbitrary</strong> way. E.g., it is
possible to connect two springs or two shafts with mass directly
together, see figure below.

<h3>Information</h3>
<p>

<p>
A flange is described by the connector class
Interfaces.<strong>Flange_a</strong>
or Interfaces.<strong>Flange_b</strong>. As already noted, the two connector
classes are completely identical. There is only a difference in the icons,
in order to easier identify a flange variable in a diagram.
Both connector classes contain the following variables:
</p>
<pre>
   Modelica.SIunits.Position   s "Absolute position of flange";
   <strong>flow</strong> Modelica.SIunits.Force f "Cut-force in the flange";
</pre>
<p>
If needed, the velocity <code>v</code> and the
acceleration <code>a</code> of a flange connector can be
determined by differentiation of the flange position <code>s</code>:
</p>
<pre>
     v = <strong>der</strong>(s);    a = <strong>der</strong>(v);

<h3>Information</h3>
<p>


<p>The following figure shows examples of components equipped with
a support flange (framed flange in the lower center), which can be used
to fix components on the ground or on other moving elements or to combine
them with force elements. Via Boolean parameter <strong>useSupport</strong>, the
support flange is enabled or disabled. If it is enabled, it must be connected.
If it is disabled, it need not be connected.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Depending on the setting of <strong>useSupport</strong>, the icon of the corresponding
component is changing, to either show the support flange or a ground mounting.
For example, the two implementations in the following figure give
identical results.

<h3>Information</h3>
<p>


<p>
The variables of a component of this library can be accessed in the
usual way. However, since most of these variables are basically elements
of <strong>vectors</strong>, i.e., have a direction, the question arises how the
signs of variables shall be interpreted. The basic idea is explained
at hand of the following figure:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../../Images/Mechanics/Translational/drive2.png" alt="drive2">
</p>

<p>
First, one has to define
a <strong>positive</strong> direction of this line, called <strong>axis of movement</strong>.
In the top part of the figure this is characterized by an arrow
defined as <code>axis of movement</code>. The simple rule is now:
If a variable of a component is positive and can be interpreted as
the element of a vector (e.g., force or velocity vector), the
corresponding vector is directed into the positive direction
of the axis of movement. In the following figure, the right-most
mass of the figure above is displayed with the positive
vector direction displayed according to this rule:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../../Images/Mechanics/Translational/drive3.png" alt="drive3">
</p>
<p>
The cut-force <code>m2.flange_a.f</code>
of the right mass is directed into the
direction of movement if the values are positive. Similarly,
the velocity <code>m2.v</code> of the right mass
is also directed into the
direction of movement if the values are positive

<h3>Information</h3>
<p>

<p>
In this section some hints are given to define your own
1-dimensional translational components which are compatible with the
elements of this package.
It is convenient to define a new
component by inheritance from one of the following base classes,
which are defined in sublibrary Interfaces:
</p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
<tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td><a href="../Interfaces/index.html#PartialCompliant">PartialCompliant</a>
  </td>
  <td>Compliant connection of two translational 1-dim. flanges
                   (used for force laws such as a spring or a damper).</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><a href="../Interfaces/index.html#PartialCompliantWithRelativeStates">PartialCompliantWithRelativeStates</a>
  </td>
  <td> Same as "PartialCompliant", but relative position and relative speed are
                    defined as preferred states. Use this partial model if the force law
                    needs anyway the relative speed. The advantage is that it is usually better
                    to use relative positions between drive train components
                    as states, especially, if the position is not limited.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><a href="../Interfaces/index.html#PartialElementaryTwoFlangesAndSupport2">PartialElementaryTwoFlangesAndSupport2</a>
</td>
  <td> Partial model for a 1-dim. translational component consisting of the flange of
                    an input shaft, the flange of an output shaft and the support.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><a href="../Interfaces/index.html#PartialForce">PartialForce</a>
</td>
  <td> Partial model of a force acting at the flange (accelerates the flange).
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><a href="../Interfaces/index.html#PartialTwoFlanges">PartialTwoFlanges</a>
</td>
  <td>General connection of two translational 1-dim. flanges.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><a href="../Interfaces/index.html#PartialAbsoluteSensor">PartialAbsoluteSensor</a>
</td>
  <td>Measure absolute flange variables.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><a href="../Interfaces/index.html#PartialRelativeSensor">PartialRelativeSensor</a>
</td>
  <td>Measure relative flange variables.
  </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The difference between these base classes are the auxiliary
variables defined in the model and the relations between
the flange variables already defined in the base class.
For example, in model <strong>PartialCompliant</strong> there is no
support flange, whereas in model
<strong>PartialElementaryTwoFlangesAndSupport2</strong>
there is a support flange.
</p>
<p>
The equations of a mechanical component are vector equations, i.e.,
they need to be expressed in a common coordinate system.
Therefore, for a component a <strong>local axis of movement</strong> has to be
defined. All vector quantities, such as cut-forces or
velocities have to be expressed according to this definition.
Examples for such a definition are given in the following figure
for a mass component:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../../Images/Mechanics/Translational/driveAxis.png" alt="driveAxis">
</p>

<p>
As can be seen, all vectors are directed into the direction
of the movement axis. The positions in the flanges are defined
correspondingly.
</p>
<p>
On first view, one may assume that the selected local
coordinate system has an influence on the usage of the
component. But this is not the case, as shown in the next figure:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../../../../Images/Mechanics/Translational/masses.png" alt="masses">
</p>

<p>
In the figure the <strong>local</strong> axes of rotation of the components
are shown. The connection of two masses in the left and in the
right part of the figure are completely equivalent, i.e., the right
part is just a different drawing of the left part. This is due to the
fact, that by a connection, the two local coordinate systems are
made identical and the (automatically) generated connection equations
(= positions are identical, cut-forces sum-up to zero) are also
expressed in this common coordinate system. Therefore, even if in
the left figure it seems to be that the velocity vector of
<code>m2</code> goes from right to left, in reality it goes from
left to right as shown in the right part of the figure, where the
local coordinate systems are drawn such that they are aligned.
Note, that the simple rule stated in section 4 (Sign conventions)
also determines that
the velocity of <code>m2</code> in the left part of the
figure is directed from left to right.
</p>
<p>
To summarize, the local coordinate system selected for a component
is just necessary, in order that the equations of this component
are expressed correctly. The selection of the coordinate system
is arbitrary and has no influence on the usage of the component.
Especially, the actual direction of, e.g., a cut-force is most
easily determined by the rule of section 4. A more strict determination
by aligning coordinate systems and then using the vector direction
of the local coordinate systems, often requires a re-drawing of the
diagram and is therefore less convenient to use.

<h3>Information</h3>
<p>

<p>
Only a few components of the Translational library use the der(..) operator
and are therefore candidates to have states. Most important, component <a href="../Components/index.html#Mass">Mass</a>
defines the absolute position and the absolute velocity of this
component as candidate for states. In the "Advanced" menu the built-in StateSelect
enumeration can be set to define the priority to use these variables as states.
Without further action, in most cases a tool will select these variables as states.
</p>

<p>
For positioning drive trains where the goal is to position a load, the absolute positions of the components are bounded,
and the issue discussed below is not present.
</p>

<p>
For drive trains where the goal is to control the velocity of a load,
the absolute positions of the components are quickly increasing
during operation. This is critical, because then the step size control of time
integrators might then no longer work appropriately:
</p>

<p>
Integrators with step size control adjust their time step size automatically
to meet user defined error bounds ("tolerances").
Typically the local error estimate EST_i is compared with a mixed bound for absolute and relative errors.
</p>

<pre>
   EST_i &le; abstol_i + reltol_i*|x_i|
</pre>

<p>
Here, abstol_i and reltol_i denote the bounds for the absolute and relative error of state variable x_i, respectively. This mixed error bound is used since it is more robust than a pure relative error based error bound if the nominal value x_i  is (very) close to 0.
In a Modelica simulation model, typically the same relative tolerance reltol is used for all
states and the absolute tolerances are computed using the relative tolerance and the
nominal values of the states:
</p>

<pre>
   reltol_i = reltol
   abstol_i = reltol*x_i(nominal)*0.01
</pre>

<p>
This error control fails if the state variable x_i grows without bounds (such as for a
drive train), since then the allowed error
also grows without bounds. The effect is that the error control on this variable is practically
switched off. The correct way to handle this would be to set reltol_i = 0 on such a state
variable and only use an absolute tolerance for the step size control.
</p>

<p>
Currently, in Modelica there is no possibility to provide this information.
In order to reduce this effect, it is advisable to not use absolute angles, but
relative angles as states. A user can define relative variables as states
explicitly with component
<a href="../Components/index.html#RelativeStates">RelativeStates</a>.
Furthermore, all compliant components, such as
<a href="../Components/index.html#SpringDamper">SpringDamper</a> are
defining the relative position and the relative velocity as preferred states.
Therefore, a tool will select in most cases relative positions as states.
</p>

<p>
The relative positions of compliant components are usually small.
Without further action, the error control would not work properly on variables
that are so small (so often switching the error control off). The remedy is to define
explicitly a nominal value on the relative angle. This definition is provided in the
"Advanced" menu of the compliant components with parameter "s_nominal".
The default value is 1e-4 m, to be in the order of a compliant deformation of a
drive.

<p>This component consists of a <strong>spherical</strong> joint 1
at frame_a, a <strong>prismatic</strong> joint at frame_b and a
<strong>spherical</strong> joint 2 which is connected via rod 1 to
the spherical joint 1 and via rod 2 to the prismatic joint, see the
default animation in the following figure (the axes vectors are not
part of the default animation):</p>

<p>Besides an optional point mass in the middle of rod 1, this
joint aggregation has no mass and no inertia, and introduces
neither constraints nor potential state variables. It should be
used in kinematic loops whenever possible since the non-linear
system of equations introduced by this joint aggregation is solved
<strong>analytically</strong> (i.e., a solution is always computed,
if a unique solution exists).</p>
<p>An additional <strong>frame_ib</strong> is present. It is
<strong>fixed</strong> in rod 2 connecting the prismatic and the
spherical joint at the side of the prismatic joint that is
connected to this rod (= rod2.frame_a = prismatic.frame_a).</p>
<p>An additional <strong>frame_im</strong> is present. It is
<strong>fixed</strong> in rod 2 connecting the prismatic and the
spherical joint at the side of spherical joint 2 that is connected
to this rod (= rod2.frame_b). It is always parallel to
<strong>frame_ib</strong>.</p>
<p>The easiest way to define the parameters of this joint is by
moving the MultiBody system in a <strong>reference
configuration</strong> where <strong>all frames</strong> of all
components are <strong>parallel</strong> to each other
(alternatively, at least frame_b and frame_ib of the JointSSP joint
should be parallel to each other when defining an instance of this
component).</p>

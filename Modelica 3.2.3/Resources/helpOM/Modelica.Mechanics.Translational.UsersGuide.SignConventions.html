<p>The variables of a component of this library can be accessed in
the usual way. However, since most of these variables are basically
elements of <strong>vectors</strong>, i.e., have a direction, the
question arises how the signs of variables shall be interpreted.
The basic idea is explained at hand of the following figure:</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Mechanics/Translational/drive2.png" alt="drive2" /></p>
<p>First, one has to define a <strong>positive</strong> direction
of this line, called <strong>axis of movement</strong>. In the top
part of the figure this is characterized by an arrow defined as
<code>axis of movement</code>. The simple rule is now: If a
variable of a component is positive and can be interpreted as the
element of a vector (e.g., force or velocity vector), the
corresponding vector is directed into the positive direction of the
axis of movement. In the following figure, the right-most mass of
the figure above is displayed with the positive vector direction
displayed according to this rule:</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.3/Resources/Images/Mechanics/Translational/drive3.png" alt="drive3" /></p>
<p>The cut-force <code>m2.flange_a.f</code> of the right mass is
directed into the direction of movement if the values are positive.
Similarly, the velocity <code>m2.v</code> of the right mass is also
directed into the direction of movement if the values are
positive</p>

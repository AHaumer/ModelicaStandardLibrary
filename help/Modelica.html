<PRE>

<p>
Package <b>Modelica</b> is a <b>standardized</b> and <b>pre-defined</b> package
that is developed together with the Modelica language from the
Modelica Association, see
<a href="http://www.Modelica.org">http://www.Modelica.org</a>.
It is also called <b>Modelica Standard Library</b>.
It provides constants, types, connectors, partial models and model
components
in various disciplines.
</p>

<p>
The Modelica package is <b>free</b> software and can be redistributed and/or
modified under the terms of the Modelica License and the accompanying
disclaimer, displayed at the end of this documentation.
</p>

<p>
The Modelica package consists currently of the following subpackages
</p>

<pre>
   <b>Constants</b>   Mathematical and physical constants (pi, eps, h, ...)
   <b>Icons</b>       Icon definitions of general interest
   <b>Math</b>        Mathematical functions (such as sin, cos)
   <b>SIunits</b>     SI-unit type definitions (such as Voltage, Torque)

   <b>Blocks</b>      Input/output blocks.
   <b>Electrical</b>  Electric and electronic components.
   <b>Mechanics</b>   Mechanical components
               (currently: 1D-rotational and 1D-translational components)
   <b>Thermal</b>     Thermal components
               (currently: 1-D heat transfer with lumped elements)
</pre>

<p>
In the Modelica package the following conventions are used:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Class and instance names are written in upper and lower case
letters, e.g., "ElectricCurrent". An underscore is only used
at the end of a name to characterize a lower or upper index,
e.g., body_low_up.<br><br>
</li>

<li>
Type names start always with an upper case letter.
Instance names start always with a lower case letter with only
a few exceptions, such as "T" for a temperature instance,
if this is common sense.<br><br>
</li>

<li>
A package XXX has its interface definitions in subpackage
XXX.Interfaces, e.g., Electrical.Interfaces. <br><br>
</li>

<li>
Preferred instance names for connectors:
<pre>
  p,n: positive and negative side of a partial model.
  a,b: side "a" and side "b" of a partial model
       (= connectors are completely equivalent).
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Release Notes:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Version 1.5 (December 16, 2002)</i><br>
    Encapsulated all example models, added new package
    <b>Thermal.HeatTransfer</b> for modeling of lumped
    heat transfer, added model <b>LossyGear</b> in Mechanics.Rotational
    to model gear efficiency and bearing friction according to a new
    theory in a robust way, added 10 new models in Electrical.Analog and 
    added several other new models and improved existing models. In total,
    55 new components have been added. A
    <a href="../Documentation/ChangeNotes1.5.html">description</a>
    of the changes is available.
    </li>
<li><i>Version 1.4.1 (June 28, 2001)</i><br>
    Several minor bugs fixed. New models:
    Modelica.Blocks.Interfaces.IntegerInPort/IntegerOutPort,
    Modelica.Blocks.Math.TwoInputs/TwoOutputs
    Modelica.Electrical.Analog.Ideal.IdealOpAmp3Pin,
    Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Move,
    Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.Move.
    </li>

<li><i>Version 1.4.1beta1 (February 12, 2001)</i><br>
    Adapted to Modelica 1.4</li>

<li><i>Version 1.3.2beta2 (June 20, 2000)</i><br>
    <ul>
    <li>New subpackage Modelica.Mechanics.<b>Translational</b></li>

    <li>Changes to Modelica.Mechanics.<b>Rotational</b>:<br>
       New elements:
<pre>
   IdealGearR2T    Ideal gear transforming rotational in translational motion.
   Position        Forced movement of a flange with a reference angle
                   given as input signal
   RelativeStates  Definition of relative state variables
</pre>
</li>

    <li>Changes to Modelica.<b>SIunits</b>:<br>
      Introduced new types:<br>
      type Temperature = ThermodynamicTemperature;<br>
      types DerDensityByEnthalpy, DerDensityByPressure,
      DerDensityByTemperature, DerEnthalpyByPressure,
      DerEnergyByDensity, DerEnergyByPressure<br>
      Attribute "final" removed from min and max values
      in order that these values can still be changed to narrow
      the allowed range of values.<br>
      Quantity="Stress" removed from type "Stress", in order
      that a type "Stress" can be connected to a type "Pressure".</li>

    <li>Changes to Modelica.<b>Icons</b>:<br>
       New icons for motors and gearboxes.</li>

    <li>Changes to Modelica.<b>Blocks.Interfaces</b>:<br>
       Introduced a replaceable signal type into
       Blocks.Interfaces.InPort/OutPort:
<pre>
   replaceable type SignalType = Real
</pre>
       in order that the type of the signal of an input/output block
       can be changed to a physical type, for example:

<pre>
   Sine sin1(outPort(redeclare type SignalType=Modelica.SIunits.Torque))
</pre>
      </li></ul>
</li>


<li><i>Version 1.3.1 (Dec. 13, 1999)</i><br>
First official release of the library.</li>
